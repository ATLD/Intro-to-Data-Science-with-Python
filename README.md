# Introduction to Data Science with Python
In this [Houston Data Science][1] meetup we will introduce our members to data science using the Python programming language.

## Objectives

* Install Python 3 and setup on your computer via the Anaconda distribution
* Install Git installed locally and have a Github account created
* Develop Python programs in a text editor, IDE and Jupyter Notebook
* Use the command line to execute a program and run Python interactively
* Use Jupyter Notebook to explore the most popular data science libraries
* Have a huge list of resources to help you continue your data science journey


## Agenda
* Install Python 3 with Anaconda
* Install Git and create a Github Account
* Install Sublime Text 3 along with packages for enhancing development
* Install PyCharm EDU
* Execute basic programs from command line
* Use the command line to run Python interactively
* PyData
* NumPy
* pandas
* statsmodels
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* connect to sqlite

# Installing Python 3 with Anaconda 
Anaconda is by far the most popular distribution of the Python programming language for data scientists. Anaconda packages together all the popular data science libraries along with the package manager `conda`. 

Anaconda is not a necessity. Python may be installed independently from source from [Python.org][2] along with its own package manager `pip`. But for begninners it is highly suggested to use Anaconda.
